  <em>I spent months applying to jobs the hard way. So I engineered the system I wish I had.</em><br>
  Companies use AI to filter candidates. <strong>I just gave candidates AI to <em>choose</em> companies.</strong><br>
  <em>Now it's open source.</em>

## What Is This

Career-Ops turns any AI coding CLI into a full job search command center. Instead of manually tracking applications in a spreadsheet, you get an AI-powered pipeline that:

- **Evaluates offers** with a structured A-F scoring system (10 weighted dimensions)
- **Generates tailored PDFs** -- ATS-optimized CVs customized per job description
- **Scans portals** automatically (Greenhouse, Ashby, Lever, company pages)
- **Processes in batch** -- evaluate 10+ offers in parallel with sub-agents
- **Tracks everything** in a single source of truth with integrity checks

> **Important: This is NOT a spray-and-pray tool.** Career-ops is a filter -- it helps you find the few offers worth your time out of hundreds. The system strongly recommends against applying to anything scoring below 4.0/5. Your time is valuable, and so is the recruiter's. Always review before submitting.

Career-ops is agentic: Claude Code navigates career pages with Playwright, evaluates fit by reasoning about your CV vs the job description (not keyword matching), and adapts your resume per listing.

> **Heads up: the first evaluations won't be great.** The system doesn't know you yet. Feed it context -- your CV, your career story, your proof points, your preferences, what you're good at, what you want to avoid. The more you nurture it, the better it gets. Think of it as onboarding a new recruiter: the first week they need to learn about you, then they become invaluable.

Built by someone who used it to evaluate 740+ job offers, generate 100+ tailored CVs, and land a Head of Applied AI role. [Read the full case study](https://santifer.io/career-ops-system).

## First-Time Setup

This folder is a clean production copy. It intentionally does not include your CV,
profile, portal list, job descriptions, reports, API keys, Gmail tokens, LinkedIn
browser sessions, or generated outputs.

### 1. Install prerequisites

Install these first:

- Node.js 18 or newer
- Python 3.10 or newer
- A terminal: PowerShell on Windows, Terminal on macOS
- Optional: Go 1.21 or newer, only for the dashboard TUI

### 2. Open this folder

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
cd "PATH\TO\career-ops"
```

macOS Terminal:

```bash
cd "/path/to/career-ops"
```

Use the folder that contains `package.json`, `run.py`, `modes/`, and
`templates/`.

### 3. Run one-command setup

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
.\setup_windows.ps1
```

macOS Terminal:

```bash
bash setup_macos.sh
```

The setup script creates `.venv`, installs Python and Node dependencies,
installs Playwright Chromium, creates missing local config files from templates,
and runs basic validation.

### 4. Manual install option

Install Node dependencies:

```bash
npm install
npx playwright install chromium
```

Playwright Chromium is required for PDF generation and reliable job-page
verification.

### 4. Install Python dependencies

Online install:

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m pip install -r apps/gmail-agent/requirements.txt
```

If this package includes a local `wheels/` folder, use the offline install
instead:

```bash
python -m pip install --no-index --find-links wheels -r requirements.txt
```

The CV import flow needs `python-docx` for `.docx` files and `pypdf` for PDF
files. `python-docx` depends on `lxml`, so offline packages must include wheels
for the user's OS, CPU, and Python version.

### 5. Create your private setup files

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
Copy-Item config\profile.example.yml config\profile.yml
Copy-Item templates\portals.example.yml portals.yml
Copy-Item .env.example .env
Copy-Item modes\_profile.template.md modes\_profile.md
Copy-Item apps\gmail-agent\.env.example apps\gmail-agent\.env
```

macOS Terminal:

```bash
cp config/profile.example.yml config/profile.yml
cp templates/portals.example.yml portals.yml
cp .env.example .env
cp modes/_profile.template.md modes/_profile.md
cp apps/gmail-agent/.env.example apps/gmail-agent/.env
```

Then edit:

- `cv.md` - create this with your CV in Markdown
- `config/profile.yml` - your name, location, target roles, salary range
- `portals.yml` - companies and search filters
- `.env` - local API keys if using standalone API scripts

Do not share or commit these files. They are ignored by `.gitignore`.

### 6. Check setup

```bash
npm run doctor
```

On a fresh copy, `doctor` will fail until `cv.md`, `config/profile.yml`,
`portals.yml`, dependencies, and browser binaries are present.

### 7. Start the guided setup

```bash
python run.py
```

For command help:

```bash
python run.py --help
```

### 8. Start using the tool

Open your AI coding CLI in this folder, then paste a job URL or run:

```text
/career-ops
```

The tool can evaluate jobs, generate tailored CV PDFs, scan configured portals,
and maintain the tracker. It never submits an application for you.

## Maintainer Release Package

Before publishing a public release, audit the full Git history:

```bash
npm run release:audit
```

If the audit reports private paths, credentials, tokens, generated reports, CVs,
or profile data, do not publish this repository history as-is. Rewrite history
carefully or create a fresh clean public repository from the safe source files.

Build a reproducible release folder, zip, and checksum:

```bash
npm run release:package
```

The package builder copies only approved files into `final run/`, excludes
private/runtime files, omits `.git`, cache, reports, output, CV/profile data,
and Gmail credentials/tokens.

> **The system is designed to be customized by Claude itself.** Modes, archetypes, scoring weights, negotiation scripts -- just ask Claude to change them. It reads the same files it uses, so it knows exactly what to edit.

See [docs/SETUP.md](docs/SETUP.md) for the full setup guide.

## Gemini CLI Integration

Career-ops supports [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli) natively — the same way it supports Claude Code and OpenCode. All 15 slash commands are available, using the same `modes/*.md` evaluation logic.

### Option A — Native Gemini CLI (Recommended)

```bash
# 1. Install Gemini CLI
npm install -g @google/gemini-cli
# or: npx @google/gemini-cli --version

# 2. Authenticate (free — uses your Google account)
gemini auth

# 3. Run in the career-ops directory
cd career-ops
gemini

# 4. Use slash commands just like Claude Code
/career-ops "Senior AI Engineer at Anthropic..."
/career-ops-evaluate --file ./jds/openai.txt
/career-ops-scan
/career-ops-pdf
/career-ops-tracker
```

The `GEMINI.md` file is auto-loaded as context. All 15 commands are defined in `.gemini/commands/*.toml`.

### Option B — Standalone API Script (No CLI install needed)

```bash
# 1. Get a free API key at https://aistudio.google.com/apikey
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env → set GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key_here

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install

# 3. Evaluate a job description
node gemini-eval.mjs "We are looking for a Senior AI Engineer..."
node gemini-eval.mjs --file ./jds/my-job.txt
npm run gemini:eval -- "JD text here"
```

> **Free tier:** Both options work without billing. Native CLI uses Google OAuth; the API script uses `gemini-2.0-flash` (15 RPM, 1M tokens/day free).

## Usage

Career-ops is a single slash command with multiple modes:

```
/career-ops                → Show all available commands
/career-ops {paste a JD}   → Full auto-pipeline (evaluate + PDF + tracker)
/career-ops scan           → Scan portals for new offers
/career-ops pdf            → Generate ATS-optimized CV
/career-ops batch          → Batch evaluate multiple offers
/career-ops tracker        → View application status
/career-ops apply          → Fill application forms with AI
/career-ops pipeline       → Process pending URLs
/career-ops contacto       → LinkedIn outreach message
/career-ops deep           → Deep company research
/career-ops training       → Evaluate a course/cert
/career-ops project        → Evaluate a portfolio project
```

Or just paste a job URL or description directly -- career-ops auto-detects it and runs the full pipeline.

## How It Works

## About the Author

I'm Santiago -- Head of Applied AI, former founder (built and sold a business that still runs with my name on it). I built career-ops to manage my own job search. It worked: I used it to land my current role.
